Side-Quest

Side-Quest is a gamified self-regulation app that treats real life like an RPG.

It is built for high-functioning individuals—engineers, professionals, creators—who are navigating burnout, emotional overload, or identity disruption, and who do not want therapy language, mood tracking, or motivational clichés.

Side-Quest never asks “How do you feel?”
It gives quests.

Core Idea

Side-Quest reframes recovery as control reclamation, not healing weakness.

Instead of introspection, journaling, or emotional analysis, the app focuses on action under interference:

Quest → Real-World Action → XP → Level Up → Visible Progress


Progress is earned by doing, not by reflecting.

Design Philosophy

No clinical language
Internal states are represented through abstract RPG metaphors such as The Fog, Static, or Low Mana.

Sensory, not direct
Mental state is inferred through indirect interaction (weather, noise, weight, motion), never through emotional questions.

Action over pity
The app acts as a Stoic Companion: calm, respectful, firm.
No consolation. No dramatization.

Control breaks loops
The system is designed to interrupt rumination, doom-scrolling, and compulsive behaviors through short, controlled actions.

Key Systems

Star-Map Onboarding
A sensory onboarding flow that calibrates pacing and difficulty without emotional labeling.

Habit Forge
30-second intervention rituals that interrupt negative loops and reward restraint with XP and artifacts.

Paths (Identity Architecture)
Long-term identity drift (Clarity, Strength, Expansion) inferred purely from behavior—never chosen or labeled.

Artifacts
Immutable proof of action, not journals or self-reports.

Local-First, Privacy-Respecting Architecture
No emotional data, no journaling, no analysis of thoughts.

🧠 Side-Quest — 200–350 Word Description

Side-Quest is a gamified self-regulation app designed for high-functioning individuals who are navigating burnout, emotional overload, or identity disruption—but who refuse to be treated as broken.

Instead of mood tracking, journaling, or therapy language, Side-Quest treats life like an RPG. It never asks “How do you feel?” It gives quests.

The core loop is simple: Quest → Action → XP → Level Up → Visible Progress. Progress is earned through real-world action, not introspection. The app is built around the idea that control—not analysis—is what breaks negative thought loops such as rumination, doom-scrolling, or compulsive checking.

Side-Quest communicates exclusively through abstract, sensory metaphors. Internal states are inferred through interactions with weather, noise, motion, and weight—never through direct emotional questions. Clinical terms are deliberately avoided in favor of mythic language like The Fog, Static, or Low Mana, removing stigma and self-judgment from the experience.

A central feature, the Habit Forge, offers short, ritualized interventions—often under 30 seconds—that interrupt compulsive behavior and reward restraint as a form of strength. Over time, the system infers long-term identity “Paths” such as Clarity, Strength, or Expansion, based purely on behavior. These paths are never chosen or labeled; they emerge naturally and fade when behavior changes.

Side-Quest is built as a local-first, privacy-respecting system. It does not record thoughts, analyze emotions, or push engagement through streaks or pressure. It is designed to step back as stability returns.

Side-Quest doesn’t try to fix people.
It reminds them they were never broken.
